# What we did:
# The push completed successfully and VillaManager is now on GitHub.
# What you did:
# Generated an SSH key and added it to your agent
# Registered the key with GitHub (e.g. as "Feb20206-SSH-key")
# Switched the remote to SSH and pushed the repo (~5.33 MiB, 224 objects)
# GitHub showing "Never used" for the key is normal; it can take a bit to update and your push confirms it’s working.
# Next steps from your deployment guide
# Part A: Create Azure Storage and upload data
# Part B: Create and configure the API App Service
# Part C: Deploy the frontend (via GitHub Actions for the SWA or App Service, now that the repo is on GitHub)
